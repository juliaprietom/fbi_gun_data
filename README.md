This repository takes look at FBI Gun Data in relation with the US census 
In this analysis, I took a look at certain factors of census data that may have an impact on gun purchasing trends. My main findings were:
- 
1. Have gun purchases increased over the years? 
Answer: Yes, gun purchases have seen a steady increase throughout the years with the exception of 2015 which saw tremendous growth in gun purchases. 
While the trends concerning gun purchases have remained the same over the years, the trends for type of guns purchased have seen an interesting change 
in the last couple of years. In the past, long guns had been the most popular, but in recent years handguns have taken their spot, and the rise of 
other guns between 2016-2018 is also worth taking notice of. Additional research would be useful to understand why this change is happening.

2. Which months, if any, see the most gun purchases? 
Answer: December is by far the month with most gun purchases, followed by March, November, and February. It is important to note that there is a 
significant drop in purchases between the months of May, June, and July.

3. Which states purchase the most guns per capita and total? 
Answer: The state with most overall gun purchases and guns per capita is Kentucky, making up for 11% of all guns in the country. 
In regards to total guns, Kentucky is followed by: California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. However, when it comes to guns per capita, 
Kentucky is followed: Indiana, Illinois, South Dakota, West Virginia, Montana, and Alabama.

4. Is there a correlation between race and guns per capita? 
Answer: The percentage of White only people in a state appears to have a positive correlation to the number of guns per capita. 
The percentage of Black only people in a state seems to have no clear correlation to the number of guns per capita. On the other hand, both Asian only 
and Hispanic percentages appear to have a weak negative correlation to the number of guns per capita.

Limitations: Since the data from the Census used only included data from 2016, these findings are confined to 2016 only.

5. Is there a correlation between the percentage of people in poverty and guns per capita? 
Answer: There appears to be a weak positive correlation between percentage of people in poverty and
guns per capita. In addition, both median household income and income per capita have a weak negative correlation to guns per capita.

Limitations: Again, the data used to understand the relationship between this census data and gun data is confined to 2016. Additional research could be made to understand whether these trends have been consistent throughout the years with the use Census data from previous years.
